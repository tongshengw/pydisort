  <i align="center">Empower Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer (DISORT) with Python 🚀</i>
</p>

## <a id='about-pydisort'> About Pydisort </a>

DISORT (Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer) is a widely-used algorithm that calculates the scattering and absorption of radiation in a medium. The original DISORT algorithm was developed by Stamnes et al. in 1988 and was implemented in `FORTRAN`. `pydisort` is a Python wrapper for the DISORT algorithm in `C`. The wrapper is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is also designed to be flexible and extensible.

> ❗ We only support Python 3.6+ on Linux and Python 3.8+ on MacOS. Anaconda is not fully supported at the moment; it only works if the Python path and `conda` environment are set correctly. For the current stage, we strongly recommend using `python3.11 -m venv env` (you Python version might differ) to create a virtual environment and install `pydisort` in this clean environment (guide provided [here](#set-up-python-virtual-environment)).

## <a id='get-started'> Get started </a>

We provide the `pydisort` library for Python users. The package can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pydisort
```

Here is a step-by-step tutorial of how to use the pydisort package:

-   Step 1. Importing the module.

```python
import pydisort
import numpy as np
```

-   Step 2. Create an instance of the disort class.

```python
# Let's assume you have a file named 'isotropic_scatering.toml' which
# has the required data for setting up generic radiation flags
ds = pydisort.disort.from_file('isotropic_scattering.toml')
```

-   Step 3. Set up the model dimension.

```python
ds.set_atmosphere_dimension(
  nlyr=1, nstr=16, nmom=16, nphase=16
).set_intensity_dimension(nuphi=1, nutau=2, numu=6).finalize()
```

This sets up a one layer of atmosphere with 16 streams for calculating radiation.

-   Step 4. Calculate scattering moments.

```python
pmom = get_legendre_coefficients(ds.get_nmom(), "isotropic")
```

-   Step 5. Set up radiation boundary condition.

```python
ds.umu0 = 0.1
ds.phi0 = 0.0
ds.albedo = 0.0
ds.fluor = 0.0
ds.fbeam = pi / ds.umu0
ds.fisot = 0.0
```

-   Step 6. Set up output optical depth and polar angles.

```python
utau = array([0.0, 0.03125])
umu = array([-1.0, -0.5, -0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0])
uphi = array([0.0])
```

-   Step 7. Run radiative transfer and get intensity result.

```python
result = ds.run_with(
	{
		"tau": [0.03125],
		"ssa": [0.2],
		"pmom": pmom,
		"utau": utau,
		"umu": umu,
		"uphi": uphi,
	}
).get_intensity()
```

Please note that this is a generic tutorial and you would need to adapt this to your specific use-case.

For example, you might need to provide your own data file in `from_file` function or fill the numpy arrays `optical_depth`, `single_scattering_albedo`, and `level_temperature` according to your requirements.

> 💡 One important point to note is that the `pydisort` library assumes that the provided arrays (optical depth, single scattering albedo, etc.) are in the numpy format and it throws exceptions if incompatible data types are provided. So, ensure that you are providing data in the right format to avoid any runtime errors.

```
$ pwd
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort
$ python3 -m venv env
```

Activate virtual environment. You’ll need to do this every time you start a new shell.

```
$ source env/bin/activate
```

👏 We now have a complete local environment for Python. Everything lives in one directory. Environment variables point to this virtual environment.

```
$ echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env
```

We have a Python interpreter installed inside the virtual environment. which python tells you exactly which python executable file will be used when you type python. Because we’re in a virtual environment, there’s more than one option!

```
$ which python3 # Default python executable
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin/python
$ which -a python # All python executables
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin/python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
/usr/bin/python3
```

There’s a package manager for Python installed in the virtual environment. That will help us install Python packages later.

```
$ which pip
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin/pip
$ pip --version
pip 23.1.2 from /Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/lib/python3.11/site-packages (python 3.11) # Your version may be different
```

Python packages live in the virtual environment. We can see that Python’s own tools are already installed (`pip` and `setuptools`).

```
$ ls env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/ # Your version may be different
pip
setuptools
...
```

Upgrade the Python tools in your virtual environment

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

### <a id='understanding-virtual-environments'>🔻 Understanding Virtual Environments </a>

This section will give more detail about virtual environments and how they work. Simply put, a virtual environment is a bunch of files (located in `env/` in this tutorial) used by Python.

#### <a id='environment'> Environment </a>

An environment is a collection of environment variables that are inputs to your shell and your programs.

Print the names and values of all environment variables using the `env` command. You’ll see `key/value` pairs used by the shell and used by programs.

```
$ env
...
PWD=/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort
HOME=/Users/zoeyzyhu
USER=zoeyzyhu
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
...
```

An important example of an environment variable is `PATH`, which tells your shell where to look for commands like `ls`, `cd`, `python` and so on. It’s a colon-separated list (`:`). You can print the value of one variable using the dollar sign `$` closely entailed by the variable.

```
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
$ printenv PATH # Alternative
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
$ echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
```

Notice that each item in the list is a directory that contains executables, for example `/usr/local/bin` usually contains the `python3` executable on macOS with Homebrew (`/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple Silicon M1).

```
$ ls /usr/local/bin
...
python3
...
```

#### <a id='environment-variables-inside-a-python-program'> Environment variables inside a Python program </a>

You can set any environment variable you want.

```
$ export MESSAGE="hello world"
$ echo $MESSAGE
hello world
```

Environment variables are accessible from programs, like this `test.py`.

```
"""test.py"""
import os
print(os.environ["MESSAGE"])
```

Set an environment variable and run the program.

```
$ export MESSAGE="hello world"
$ python3 test.py
hello world
```

This example shows that environment variables are simply another way to provide input to a running program.

#### <a id='virtual-environment'> Virtual environment </a>

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation and a number of additional Python packages.

As you saw earlier, the command to create a virtual environment creates a new directory, `env` in this example.

```
$ python3 -m venv env # you ran this earlier
$ ls env/
bin include lib pyvenv.cfg
```

The virtual environment contains a `bin/` directory with executables. It also contains a `lib/ `directory where Python third party packages live. Your versions might be different.

```
$ ls env/bin/
...
pip
python
...
$ ls env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/ # Your version may be different
**pycache** pip-23.1.2.dist-info setuptools-65.6.3.dist-info
easy_install.py pkg_resources pip setuptools
```

A pre-configured `pip` executable installs third party packages to `lib/`. Your versions of Python and jinja2 may be different.

```
$ ./env/bin/pip install tomli
Successfully installed tomli-2.0.1
$ ls env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/tomli/ # Your version may be different
**init**.py
...
```

A pre-configured `python` executable in `bin/` uses the third party packages in `lib/`.

```
$ ./env/bin/python
>>> import tomli
>>> tomli.**version**
>>> '2.0.1'
```

<div align="right">[ <a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to top ↑</a> ]</div>

#### <a id='why-virtual-environments'> Why virtual environments? </a>

Virtual environments are useful when you want to install different Python programs that have different third party package dependencies. For example, you might have a virtual environment for a `pydisort` project, and a different one for your machine learning project. The two projects have different third party packages and different versions of those packages.

#### <a id='activate-a-virtual-environment'> Activate a virtual environment </a>

In the previous example, we used the virtual environment by calling its Python executable explicitly (e.g., `./env/bin/python`). As a convenience, we can temporarily make this version the default.

The `bin/activate` script adds `env/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable, making it the first place to look for commands. Notice that `/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin` is first in the list.

```
$ source env/bin/activate
$ echo $PATH
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
$ echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
```

Ask the shell where all the `python` executables live, then which one is the default.

```
$ which -a python
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin/python
/usr/local/bin/python
/usr/bin/python
$ which python
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin/python
```

Finally, the `activate` script sets a `$VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable, which contains the path to the virtual environment directory.

```
$ echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env
```

#### <a id='replicate-a-virtual-environment'> Replicate a virtual environment </a>

In the previous section, we created a Python virtual environment, activated it, and upgraded the Python installer tools (`pip`, `setuptools`). We have not yet installed any new third party Python packages.

```
$ pwd
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort
$ echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env
$ pip list

Package Version

---

pip 22.3.1
setuptools 65.6.3
```

A `requirements.txt` file lists the exact third party Python packages and their versions needed to replicate another virtual environment. This is useful for ensuring that developers and production servers have identical packages with identical versions. It’s also useful for ensuring that students and the autograder have identical packages with identical versions.

See an example list of package dependencies provided in a `requirements.txt` file below.bei

```
$ cat requirements.txt
tomli==2.0.1
...
zipp==3.15.0
```

Install the package dependencies. Your output might be different.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
...
Successfully installed tomli-2.0.1 ... zipp-3.15.0
$ pip list
Package Version

---

tomli 2.0.1
...
zipp 3.15.0
```

#### <a id='deactivate-a-virtual-environment'> Deactivate a virtual environment </a>

The deactivate command simply modifies two environment variables, `PATH` and `VIRTUAL_ENV`. First, it unsets `VIRTUAL_ENV`.

```
$ deactivate
$ echo $VIRTUAL_ENV # Variable not set, output is blank
```

Finally, `deactivate` changes `PATH` to its previous value, before the virtual environment was activated.

```
$ echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
```

### <a id='summary'>🔻 Summary </a>

A Python virtual environment helps you manage third party packages. A pre-configured python executable in `./env/bin/` uses the third party packages in `./env/lib/` (the name of `env/` is your choice).

Activate the virtual environment each time you start a new shell.

```
$ pwd
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort
$ source env/bin/activate
```

The activate script changes the `PATH` environment variable, which temporarily changes the default python and pip executables.

```
$ which python
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin/python
$ which pip
/Users/zoeyzyhu/projects/pydisort/env/bin/pip
```
